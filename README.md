# QuantumGenetic Classifier

## Overview
QuantumGenetic Classifier is a machine learning solution that combines the power of quantum computing with classical genetic algorithms to perform classification tasks. It utilizes a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC), which leverages quantum circuits to classify data, and employs genetic algorithms for optimizing the quantum circuit parameters. This approach aims to improve classification accuracy by optimizing the performance of the quantum classifier.

## Technical Details
The QuantumGenetic Classifier consists of two main stages:

- **Variational Quantum Classification (VQC):** In this stage, a quantum circuit is used to classify data points. The quantum circuit comprises a feature map and a variational form. The feature map encodes classical data into quantum states, while the variational form, controlled by a set of parameters, transforms these quantum states. The output of the VQC provides the classification of the input data.

- **Genetic Algorithm Optimization:** The second stage involves the use of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the parameters of the variational form in the VQC. The GA is a bio-inspired algorithm that emulates natural selection to find the optimal set of parameters. Each individual in the GA population represents a different set of parameters, and through selection, crossover, and mutation operations, the GA evolves the population to minimize the test error of the VQC.

By integrating these two stages, the QuantumGenetic Classifier optimizes the parameters of the quantum circuit using a genetic algorithm, aiming to improve the classification performance.

## Key Features
- **Parameterized Quantum Circuits:** The QuantumGenetic Classifier allows parameterization of quantum circuits, enabling fine-tuning and optimization of the VQC, leading to improved performance.
- **Genetic Algorithm Optimization:** The GA provides a robust optimization method that can discover parameter configurations that may not be found by gradient-based methods, potentially enhancing the performance of the VQC.
- **Fitness Evaluation:** The fitness of individuals in the GA population is evaluated based on the test accuracy of the VQC. The GA evolves the parameters towards solutions that yield higher test accuracy.
- **Preservation of Best Solutions:** The QuantumGenetic Classifier includes a Hall of Fame feature that preserves the best solution found during the evolution process, ensuring that the optimal parameter configuration is not lost.
- **Utilization of Standard Genetic Operators:** The implementation incorporates standard genetic operators, such as mutation (uniform) and crossover (uniform), to generate new offspring with diverse parameter configurations.
- **Customizable Feature Map and Variational Form Functions:** The QuantumGenetic Classifier allows users to define their own feature map and variational form functions with parameters to further customize the VQC according to their specific problem requirements.
- **Decision Boundary Visualization:** The implementation includes a function for plotting decision boundaries of the VQC, enabling users to visualize the classification performance on the test dataset.
- **Efficient Transpilation:** The QuantumGenetic Classifier incorporates transpilation techniques to improve the computational efficiency of the quantum circuits.

## Usage
The QuantumGenetic Classifier is designed to solve classification problems and can be utilized in any scenario where a classification model is required, including binary classification tasks in machine learning. To use the classifier, you need to provide the training and testing data. The algorithm takes care of the rest, from creating the quantum circuits to optimizing the parameters using the genetic algorithm.

## Custom Data Integration:
To use your own data with the code, you can follow these steps:

- Prepare your Training and Testing Data: Instead of using the ad_hoc_data function, you will need to prepare your own training and testing datasets. Ensure that the datasets are formatted appropriately, with the features and corresponding labels properly structured.

- Replace the Training and Testing Data Variables: Assign your own training and testing datasets to the training_input and test_input variables, respectively. Make sure to update the variables training_dataset_size and testing_dataset_size with the appropriate sizes of your datasets.

- Map Labels (if necessary): If your labels are not in the desired format, you may need to perform label mapping. Use the map_label_to_class_name function to map your labels to class names if required.

- Modify the Feature Map and Variational Form Functions (if necessary): Depending on the characteristics of your data, you may need to customize the custom_feature_map and custom_variational_form functions to match the number of features in your data and the complexity of the classification task.

Here's a concrete example of using the system for a binary classification task, with step-by-step execution and output:

```
from qiskit import IBMQ
import numpy as np

# 1. First, let's set up the system with your IBMQ credentials
IBMQ.save_account('YOUR_API_TOKEN')

# 2. Create a simple dataset (you can replace this with your own data)
def create_sample_dataset():
    # Create two interleaved half moons
    n_samples = 100
    noise = 0.1
    
    # First half moon
    t = np.linspace(0, np.pi, n_samples//2)
    x1 = np.cos(t)
    y1 = np.sin(t) + np.random.normal(0, noise, n_samples//2)
    
    # Second half moon
    x2 = np.cos(t + np.pi)
    y2 = np.sin(t + np.pi) + np.random.normal(0, noise, n_samples//2)
    
    X = np.vstack([np.column_stack((x1, y1)), np.column_stack((x2, y2))])
    y = np.hstack([np.zeros(n_samples//2), np.ones(n_samples//2)])
    
    return X, y

# 3. Run the example
def run_classification_example():
    # Create dataset
    X, y = create_sample_dataset()
    print("Dataset created with shape:", X.shape)
    
    # Initialize the quantum ML system
    quantum_ml = AdvancedQuantumMLSystem(
        n_qubits=4,  # Number of qubits to use
        n_layers=2,  # Number of quantum layers
        backend_name='ibmq_qasm_simulator'  # Use simulator for this example
    )
    
    # Initialize data pipeline
    data_pipeline = QuantumDataPipeline(n_qubits=4)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = data_pipeline.prepare_data(X, y)
    
    print("\nStarting training...")
    # Train the model
    history = quantum_ml.train(
        X_train,
        y_train,
        epochs=20,  # Reduced epochs for example
        batch_size=16
    )
    
    # Evaluate the model
    metrics = quantum_ml.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
    print("\nTest Results:")
    print(f"Accuracy: {metrics['accuracy']:.4f}")
    print(f"Quantum Circuit Depth: {metrics['circuit_depth']}")
    
    # Visualize results
    visualizer = QuantumVisualization(quantum_ml)
    visualizer.plot_training_history()
    visualizer.plot_decision_boundary(X, y)
    
    return quantum_ml, metrics

# 4. Add some example predictions
def make_predictions(quantum_ml, X_new):
    # Example of making predictions for new data points
    predictions = quantum_ml.predict(X_new)
    return predictions

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run the complete example
    print("Starting Quantum ML Classification Example...")
    
    # Run main classification
    quantum_ml, metrics = run_classification_example()
    
    # Make some example predictions
    X_new = np.array([
        [0.5, 0.5],
        [-0.5, -0.5],
        [0.0, 1.0]
    ])
    
    predictions = make_predictions(quantum_ml, X_new)
    print("\nPredictions for new data points:")
    for i, pred in enumerate(predictions):
        print(f"Point {i+1}: Class {pred}")
    
    # Save the model
    quantum_ml.save_model("example_quantum_model.json")
    print("\nModel saved successfully!")
```
Expected output would look something like this:

```
