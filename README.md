# QuantumGenetic Classifier

## Overview
QuantumGenetic Classifier is a machine learning solution that combines the power of quantum computing with classical genetic algorithms to perform classification tasks. It utilizes a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC), which leverages quantum circuits to classify data, and employs genetic algorithms for optimizing the quantum circuit parameters. This approach aims to improve classification accuracy by optimizing the performance of the quantum classifier.

## Technical Details
The QuantumGenetic Classifier consists of two main stages:

- **Variational Quantum Classification (VQC):** In this stage, a quantum circuit is used to classify data points. The quantum circuit comprises a feature map and a variational form. The feature map encodes classical data into quantum states, while the variational form, controlled by a set of parameters, transforms these quantum states. The output of the VQC provides the classification of the input data.

- **Genetic Algorithm Optimization:** The second stage involves the use of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the parameters of the variational form in the VQC. The GA is a bio-inspired algorithm that emulates natural selection to find the optimal set of parameters. Each individual in the GA population represents a different set of parameters, and through selection, crossover, and mutation operations, the GA evolves the population to minimize the test error of the VQC.

By integrating these two stages, the QuantumGenetic Classifier optimizes the parameters of the quantum circuit using a genetic algorithm, aiming to improve the classification performance.

## Key Features
- **Parameterized Quantum Circuits:** The QuantumGenetic Classifier allows parameterization of quantum circuits, enabling fine-tuning and optimization of the VQC, leading to improved performance.
- **Genetic Algorithm Optimization:** The GA provides a robust optimization method that can discover parameter configurations that may not be found by gradient-based methods, potentially enhancing the performance of the VQC.
- **Fitness Evaluation:** The fitness of individuals in the GA population is evaluated based on the test accuracy of the VQC. The GA evolves the parameters towards solutions that yield higher test accuracy.
- **Preservation of Best Solutions:** The QuantumGenetic Classifier includes a Hall of Fame feature that preserves the best solution found during the evolution process, ensuring that the optimal parameter configuration is not lost.
- **Utilization of Standard Genetic Operators:** The implementation incorporates standard genetic operators, such as mutation (Gaussian) and crossover (blend), to generate new offspring with diverse parameter configurations.

## Usage
The QuantumGenetic Classifier is designed to solve classification problems and can be utilized in any scenario where a classification model is required, including binary classification tasks in machine learning. To use the classifier, you need to provide the training and testing data. The algorithm takes care of the rest, from creating the quantum circuits to optimizing the parameters using the genetic algorithm.

# Custom Data Integration:
To use your own data with the code, you can follow these steps:

- Prepare your Training and Testing Data: Instead of using the ad_hoc_data function, you will need to prepare your own training and testing datasets. Ensure that the datasets are formatted appropriately, with the features and corresponding labels properly structured.

- Replace the Training and Testing Data Variables: Assign your own training and testing datasets to the training_input and test_input variables, respectively. Make sure to update the variables training_dataset_size and testing_dataset_size with the appropriate sizes of your datasets.

- Map Labels (if necessary): If your labels are not in the desired format, you may need to perform label mapping. Use the map_label_to_class_name function to map your labels to class names if required.

- Modify the Feature Map and Variational Form Functions (if necessary): Depending on the characteristics of your data, you may need to customize the custom_feature_map and custom_variational_form functions to match the number of features in your data and the complexity of the classification task.

Please note that the provided code examples assume the use of the IBM Quantum backend, but you can adapt it to different environments or backends based on your specific requirements.
